Okay, let's outline some example use cases for an agent-to-agent (A2A) feature for your crowdfunding application using Coinbase AgentKit, focusing on a Research Agent, a Marketing Agent, and an Account Agent, and how they could collaborate.

We'll use the `SmartWalletProvider` for on-chain interactions and the `TwitterActionProvider` for social outreach.

**1. Setting up AgentKit**

First, let's set up your AgentKit instance. This will provide the tools (actions) that your agents can use.

```typescript
import {
    AgentKit,
    SmartWalletProvider,
    SmartWalletConfig,
    // Assuming TwitterActionProvider is available and needs to be imported
    // This might be part of a larger social provider or a specific Twitter one.
    // For this example, let's hypothesize its import and instantiation.
    // Based on the docs, a TwitterActionProvider exists.
} from "@coinbase/agentkit";
import { TwitterActionProvider } from "@coinbase/agentkit"; // Hypothetical import, adjust if different
import { cdpApiActionProvider, pythActionProvider } from "@coinbase/agentkit"; // As in your example
import { generatePrivateKey, privateKeyToAccount } from "viem/accounts";
import { WalletProvider } from "@coinbase/agentkit"; // Base type for walletProvider

// --- Configuration ---
// Ensure these are set in your environment or a config file
const CDP_API_KEY_NAME = process.env.CDP_API_KEY_NAME!;
const CDP_API_KEY_PRIVATE = process.env.CDP_API_KEY_PRIVATE!;

const NETWORK_ID = process.env.NETWORK_ID || "base-sepolia";
const YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY || generatePrivateKey(); // Your EOA private key for the signer
const SMART_WALLET_ADDRESS = process.env.SMART_WALLET_ADDRESS || undefined; // Optional: if you have an existing smart wallet
const PAYMASTER_URL = process.env.PAYMASTER_URL || undefined; // Optional: for sponsored transactions

// Twitter provider might need its own auth config (e.g., API keys via env vars)
// For simplicity, we'll assume TwitterActionProvider() can be called directly
// or it picks up auth from environment variables.
// const twitterAuthConfig = { /* ... your twitter auth details ... */ };

async function initializeAgentKit(): Promise<AgentKit> {
    // 1. Configure Smart Wallet Provider
    const signer = privateKeyToAccount(YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY as `0x${string}`);

    const smartWalletConfig: SmartWalletConfig = {
        networkId: NETWORK_ID,
        signer,
        smartWalletAddress: SMART_WALLET_ADDRESS,
        paymasterUrl: PAYMASTER_URL,
    };
    const walletProvider: WalletProvider = await SmartWalletProvider.configureWithWallet(smartWalletConfig);
    console.log(`SmartWalletProvider configured for address: ${await walletProvider.getAddress()}`);

    // 2. Instantiate Action Providers
    // The TwitterActionProvider would give access to twitter_account_details, twitter_post_tweet etc.
    // Its instantiation might require API keys or auth tokens.
    const twitterProvider = TwitterActionProvider({
        // Configuration for Twitter API access would go here
        // e.g., consumerKey: process.env.TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY, etc.
        // For this example, we assume it's configured to use a specific Twitter account.
    });

    const allActionProviders = [
        // cdpApiActionProvider({ // If you need CDP actions like deploy_contract, trade
        //     apiKeyName: CDP_API_KEY_NAME,
        //     apiKeyPrivate: CDP_API_KEY_PRIVATE,
        // }),
        // pythActionProvider(), // If you need price feeds
        twitterProvider,
        // You might add other providers like an ERC20 provider for balance checks, etc.
    ];

    // 3. Create AgentKit Instance
    const agentKit = await AgentKit.from({
        walletProvider,
        actionProviders: allActionProviders,
    });

    console.log("AgentKit initialized successfully.");
    return agentKit;
}

// Usage:
// const agentKitInstance = await initializeAgentKit();
// Now you can build agents that use agentKitInstance.getTools() or agentKitInstance.run(actionName, args)
```
*(Note: The actual instantiation and configuration of `TwitterActionProvider` would depend on its specific implementation in AgentKit. The above is a structural example.)*

**2. Example Agent Use Cases for Crowdfunding**

Let's define the roles for our agents. These agents would be separate logical units in your application, each using the same `agentKitInstance` to perform actions.

**Agent 1: Prospecting Agent (Research)**

*   **Goal:** Identify potential donors on Twitter who are likely interested in the fundraiser's cause.
*   **Tools (AgentKit Actions):**
    *   `twitter_account_mentions`: To monitor mentions of the fundraiser's main Twitter account or relevant hashtags.
    *   `twitter_account_details`: To get profile information of users who engage or are identified as potential leads. (Note: This gets details of the *authenticated* account. To get details of *other* users, the Twitter API typically requires user IDs/screen names. The Prospecting Agent might focus on analyzing users who interact with the campaign's primary account/tweets).
    *   (Potentially) Custom actions for broader Twitter searches if the built-in ones are limited.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  Monitors tweets mentioning the fundraiser or specific keywords/hashtags related to the cause.
    2.  When a user engages positively (e.g., likes, retweets with positive sentiment, asks questions), the agent can attempt to fetch more details about them (if the API allows for the authenticated agent).
    3.  Analyzes user profiles (bio, past public tweets - if accessible) to gauge their interest in similar causes or past philanthropic activity.
    4.  Compiles a list of qualified prospects.
*   **Output:** A list of Twitter user profiles/handles deemed as high-potential donors, passed to the Outreach Agent.

**Agent 2: Outreach Agent (Marketing)**

*   **Goal:** Engage qualified prospects with personalized messages to inform them about the fundraiser and encourage participation.
*   **Tools (AgentKit Actions):**
    *   `twitter_post_tweet`: To send out general updates or engage users publicly.
    *   `twitter_post_tweet_reply`: To reply directly to prospects' tweets or mentions.
    *   An LLM (like GPT via LangChain, integrated with AgentKit tools) to generate personalized messages.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  Receives the list of prospects from the Prospecting Agent.
    2.  For each prospect, uses an LLM to craft a personalized message. The message could reference the prospect's known interests (if ethically and publicly available) or their recent relevant tweet.
    3.  Uses `twitter_post_tweet_reply` to send the personalized message as a reply to one of their tweets or a tweet they engaged with, or `twitter_post_tweet` to mention them in a new, relevant tweet.
    4.  Monitors responses to these outreach messages.
*   **Output:** A list of engaged prospects who have shown interest in learning more or donating, passed to the Donor Relations Agent.

**Agent 3: Donor Relations Agent (Account & Payment)**

*   **Goal:** Guide interested prospects through the donation process, answer questions, and manage post-donation acknowledgments.
*   **Tools (AgentKit Actions):**
    *   `twitter_post_tweet_reply`: For continued conversation with the prospect.
    *   `wallet_get_wallet_details`: To provide the Smart Wallet address if direct crypto donations are being accepted to this wallet.
    *   (Potentially) `erc20_get_balance` or `native_get_balance` (if an ERC20/Native token provider is added) to check for incoming donations to the Smart Wallet.
    *   (Potentially) `native_transfer` or an ERC20 transfer action if, for example, thank-you tokens or NFTs are sent from the Smart Wallet.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  Receives engaged prospects from the Outreach Agent.
    2.  Engages in a more detailed conversation via Twitter replies, answering specific questions about the fundraiser.
    3.  Provides donation information:
        *   A link to the crowdfunding platform's page.
        *   If accepting direct crypto donations to the agent's Smart Wallet: Uses `wallet_get_wallet_details` to fetch and share the wallet address associated with the `SmartWalletProvider`.
    4.  Monitors for donations (this might involve checking the crowdfunding platform's backend or, for direct crypto donations, querying the blockchain â€“ potentially using another AgentKit action if available, or an external service).
    5.  Once a donation is confirmed, sends a thank-you message via `twitter_post_tweet_reply` or `twitter_post_tweet`.
    6.  Optionally, if the campaign involves sending small thank-you tokens/NFTs, this agent could trigger a transaction from the Smart Wallet.
*   **Output:** Donation confirmations, updated donor list, public acknowledgments (if appropriate).

**How They Work Together (A2A Flow):**

1.  **Initiation:** The crowdfunding campaign is launched, perhaps with an initial announcement tweet (can be posted by one of the agents or manually).
2.  **Prospecting:** The **Prospecting Agent** starts monitoring Twitter using `twitter_account_mentions` for engagement around the campaign. It identifies User A who retweets the campaign announcement with an enthusiastic comment. The agent adds User A to a list of prospects.
3.  **Handover 1:** The Prospecting Agent passes the list (containing User A) to the **Outreach Agent**. This handover could be via a shared database, a message queue, or a direct API call depending on your application's architecture.
4.  **Personalized Outreach:** The **Outreach Agent** takes User A's profile. It uses an LLM to draft a reply: "Thanks for your support, User A! We noticed you're passionate about [topic related to User A's bio/tweets]. Our fundraiser aims to make a big impact in this area. Would you like to know more?" It then posts this using `twitter_post_tweet_reply`.
5.  **Engagement & Handover 2:** User A replies, "Yes, please! How can I contribute?" The Outreach Agent flags User A as highly interested and passes them to the **Donor Relations Agent**.
6.  **Donation Facilitation:** The **Donor Relations Agent** replies to User A: "That's great! You can contribute via [link to platform] or directly to our project's secure wallet: [uses `wallet_get_wallet_details` to provide the Smart Wallet address]. Let us know if you have questions!"
7.  **Confirmation & Acknowledgment:** User A donates. The system (or the Donor Relations Agent by checking balances/platform) confirms the donation. The Donor Relations Agent then sends a public thank you: "Huge thanks to User A for their generous contribution! #AwesomeDonor".

This A2A system automates and personalizes the outreach and engagement process for your crowdfunding campaign, leveraging AgentKit's capabilities for both on-chain (Smart Wallet interactions) and off-chain (Twitter) actions. The key is the orchestration layer you build around these agents to manage state and information flow between them.
