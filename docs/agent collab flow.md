Excellent use case! Let me break down how these three agents would work together in a fundraising campaign using the A2A protocol. Here's a comprehensive example:This shows exactly how your three agents would work together in a fundraising campaign! Here's the key workflow:

## The Agent Collaboration Flow:

**Research Agent** → **Marketing Agent** → **Account Agent**

1. **Research Agent** finds prospects who follow environmental influencers and have donation history
2. **Marketing Agent** receives prospect data and creates personalized strategies (tech professionals get ROI-focused messaging, activists get emotional appeals)
3. **Account Agent** takes the strategies and executes outreach, handles conversations, and processes payments

## Real-World Example:

**Prospect Found**: Software engineer at Tesla who follows climate activists

- **Research Agent**: "High-value prospect, interested in clean tech, donated $500 to similar causes"
- **Marketing Agent**: "Use technical language, emphasize innovation impact, suggest $750 donation"
- **Account Agent**: "Sent LinkedIn message with carbon reduction calculations, prospect engaged, payment completed: $800"

## Advanced Features:

- **Real-time optimization**: If Research Agent notices tech outreach isn't working, Marketing Agent adjusts messaging, Account Agent implements changes
- **Batch processing**: Marketing Agent can create strategies for 100+ prospects simultaneously
- **Payment automation**: Account Agent handles the entire payment flow with multiple options
- **Continuous learning**: All agents share learnings to improve future campaigns

The beauty is that each agent can specialize and excel at their specific task, while the A2A protocol enables seamless handoffs and real-time collaboration. The system can run 24/7, scaling to thousands of prospects while maintaining personalization.

Would you like me to dive deeper into any specific agent's capabilities or show how this could integrate with the AgentKit wallet functionality for crypto donations?
