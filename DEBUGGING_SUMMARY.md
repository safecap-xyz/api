# Orchestrate Endpoint Debugging Enhancements

## Overview
Added comprehensive logging to the orchestrate endpoint (`/api/agent/orchestrate`) to debug weather tool functionality issues after a recent refactor.

## Debug Features Added

### 1. Orchestrate Endpoint Logging (`api/routes/mastra.ts`)
- **Request logging**: Full request details including headers, body, timestamps
- **API key validation**: Detailed validation steps and results
- **Agent interaction logging**: Separate tracking for first agent (analysis) and second agent (formatting)
- **Response inspection**: Detailed analysis of agent responses including tool call detection
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error logging with stack traces and error types
- **SSE event tracking**: All Server-Sent Events are logged with their data

### 2. MastraService Tool Handling (`services/mastraService.ts`)
- **Tool call detection**: Enhanced logging when tool calls are detected
- **Weather tool identification**: Specific detection logic for weather-related tools
- **Tool argument parsing**: Safe JSON parsing with error handling
- **Weather-specific responses**: Realistic weather data responses for detected weather tools
- **Tool result summary**: Overview of all tool executions and their status

### 3. Enhanced Prompts
- Updated analysis prompt to explicitly request weather tool usage
- Added instructions to use available tools for current information
- Specific mention of weather information gathering

## Key Debug Sections

### 🚀 Orchestrate Endpoint Called
Shows when the endpoint is hit with full request details.

### 🔐 API Key Validation
Tracks the API key validation process.

### 🧠 Analysis Prompt Preparation
Shows the prompt being sent to the first agent.

### 🤖 Agent Calls
Detailed logging for both agent interactions with response analysis.

### 🔧 Tool Calls Handler
Comprehensive tool call processing with weather detection.

### 🌤️ Weather Tool Detection
Specific logging when weather tools are identified and processed.

### ❌ Error Handling
Detailed error logging throughout the process.

## Expected Tool Behavior

The orchestrate endpoint now expects:
1. First agent to receive task analysis prompt
2. Agent to potentially make tool calls (especially weather-related)
3. Tool calls to be processed by MastraService
4. Weather tools to be detected and handled with realistic responses
5. Second agent to format the final response

## Debugging a Request

When testing, look for these log sections in order:
1. `🚀 === ORCHESTRATE ENDPOINT CALLED ===`
2. `🔐 API Key Validation...`
3. `🧠 === PREPARING ANALYSIS PROMPT ===`
4. `🤖 === CALLING FIRST AGENT (Analysis) ===`
5. `🔍 === ANALYSIS RESPONSE INSPECTION ===`
6. `🔧 === TOOL CALLS HANDLER INVOKED ===` (if tools are called)
7. `🌤️ === WEATHER TOOL DETECTED ===` (if weather tools)
8. `🤖 === CALLING SECOND AGENT (Formatting) ===`
9. `🏁 === ORCHESTRATION COMPLETION ===`

## Troubleshooting

If weather tools are not being called:
1. Check if the Mastra agent has weather tools configured
2. Verify the agent is attempting to use tools (look for tool_calls in responses)
3. Check if the task/prompt is triggering tool usage
4. Ensure the Mastra service is properly configured to handle tool calls

## Files Modified
- `api/routes/mastra.ts` - Enhanced orchestrate endpoint with comprehensive logging
- `services/mastraService.ts` - Enhanced tool call handling with weather detection
- Created this debugging summary

## Next Steps
1. Test the orchestrate endpoint with weather-related tasks
2. Monitor logs for tool call patterns
3. Implement actual weather API integration if tools are working
4. Debug any specific issues found in the logs
